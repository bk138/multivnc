## 2.0.0

Version 2.0.0 is the culmination of the 1.9.x series and marks the completion of
exchanging the previous Java-based RFB engine with a fully native one based on
[LibVNCClient](https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver). Here's why:

It's more feature-rich: the native backend now supports Apple Remote Desktop
servers (i.e. all Macs), UltraVNC's MSLogon security type (Microsoft Windows)
and Vino's AnonTLS authentication (GNOME's remote desktop server).

It's faster: with LibVNCClient, MultiVNC can now finally make use of Tight VNC
encoding, a lossy JPEG encoding which drastically reduces needed throughput capacity.
Also, the now-native JPEG decoding can make use of [libjpeg-turbo](https://www.libjpeg-turbo.org/),
a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions to accelerate JPEG decompression.

Big thanks go out to [Gaurav Ujjwal](https://github.com/gujjwal00) who contributed
a lot of very good UI improvements as well as under-the-hood changes. You might want
to check out his excellent [AVNC VNC client for Android](https://github.com/gujjwal00/avnc). 
Thanks also to Alexandr Kondratev, Sergiy Stupar, Suso ComesaÃ±a, ferrumcccp,
nagasawa and Frischid for contributing code and translations.
