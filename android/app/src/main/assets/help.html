<h1>Using MultiVNC</h1>
Welcome to the MultiVNC help page! This will give a short introduction on the viewer's basic operation.

<h2>Basic Control</h2>
After connecting, you start out in View mode, where you can actually see the remote desktop. Your pointer will be <b>highlighted</b> by a
purple circle - you can turn that feature off via the menu.
<br/><br/>
At the bottom of the screen will be three <b>virtual mouse buttons</b>. These can
also be turned off, but you will want to use them, as they enable you to drag things around on the remote desktop. When virtual mouse buttons
are disabled, a single tap anywhere on the screen will emulate a left mouse button click. A double tap will send a right mouse button click
to the remote side.
<br/><br/>
The <b>keyboard</b> can be toggled on and off via the menu or the keyboard button at the bottom of the screen.
<br/><br/>
<b>Copy & Paste</b> to and from the Android clipboard is done automatically, MultiVNC keeps the remote's clipboard in sync with the local one.
Just use the usual means of clipboard manipulation on the remote (Ctrl-C & Ctrl-V on Windows/OS X, select and middle mouse button on Unix).
<br/><br/>
<b>Scrolling</b> up/down can be done using the hardware volume keys of your device.

<h2>Gestures</h2>
<h3>Scaling</h3>
Zooming in and out of the screen is hardware accelerated via OpenGL and can be initiated in two ways: First is simply with a two-finger
<b>pinch gesture</b>. On low-end devices that do not support multitouch, zooming can also be done via the zoom controls at the bottom of the screen.
<h3>Swipe Arrow Keys</h3>
By <b>swiping left, right, up or down with two fingers</b>, you can send a left, right, up or down arrow key to the remote side. Handy for controlling presentation
slides or the like.



<h2>Touchpad Mode</h2>
This is a <b>really fast</b> remote control mode specific to MultiVNC where no screen contents are transmitted at all. Intended for situations
where you do not need to see the remote screen, e. g. for remote controlling your laptop connected to a projector from your phone during a
presentation. Can be enabled via the menu.



<h2>Bookmarking</h2>
If you want to bookmark the current connection, simply tap the bookmark save entry. A bookmark will be created for later access.
