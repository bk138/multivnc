MultiVNC is a cross-platform Multicast-enabled VNC viewer based on
[LibVNCClient](https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver). The desktop version
uses [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) and runs on Unix, Mac OS X and
Windows. There also is an [Android version](/android/).

The roadmap for future developments regarding the project can be found
[here](https://github.com/bk138/multivnc/projects).

## Features

* Support for most VNC encodings including Tight.
* TLS support, i.e. AnonTLS and VeNCrypt.
* Discovery of VNC servers advertising themselves via ZeroConf.
* Bookmarking of connections.
* Supports server framebuffer resize.
* Experimental support for MulticastVNC.

### Android-only Features

* Support for SSH-Tunnelling with password- and privkey-based authentication.
* UltraVNC Repeater support.
* Import and export of saved connections.
* Virtual mouse button controls with haptic feedback.
* Two-finger swipe gesture recognition.
* A super fast touchpad mode for local use.
* Hardware-accelerated OpenGL drawing and zooming.
* Copy&paste to and from Android.

### Desktop-only Features

* Several connections with one viewer using tabs.
* Listen mode (Reverse VNC). Via tabs it's possible to listen 
  for and serve multiple incoming connections.
* Record and replay of user input macros.
* Under X11, seamless control of the remote side by moving pointer over the
  (default upper) screen edge. Borrows heavily from x2vnc by
  Fredrik HÃ¼binette <hubbe@hubbe.net>, which in turn was based on
  ideas from x2x and code from vncviewer.
* Simple, loggable statistics.

select the last successful one and download the wanted artifact.

## How to build

### MultiVNC for Android

See the [Android version's README](android/README.md).

### MultiVNC for Desktop

After cloning the repo, do

```
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
```

To build:

```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   cpack
```

Depending on which OS you are on, you end up with a .deb, .dmg or .exe you can install.

## MulticastVNC notes

You can get a modified libvncserver/libvncclient at
https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/tree/multicastvnc -
this is the same library that MultiVNC uses internally.
